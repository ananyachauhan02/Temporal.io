## 📌 What is Temporal.io?

- Temporal.io is a workflow orchestration platform designed to help developers build reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant applications. It ensures that long-running workflows execute without losing progress, even in the face of failures.
Temporal provides stateful execution, meaning it maintains the execution state of workflows indefinitely. It automatically handles failures, retries, and task scheduling, making distributed applications more resilient.
